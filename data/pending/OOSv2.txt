❗ Remaining states I researched but could not find a short authoritative public statement for; I mark these as (needs verification) and summarize the best available evidence or reasonable practice:
South Carolina — Probably excludes “O” on standard serials (many states omit I/O/Q to avoid confusion); I found serial-format descriptions but not a clear, single rule text. (needs verification: check South Carolina DMV / registration specs).
South Dakota — Unknown from quick public sources; no clear official note found. (needs verification).
Utah — I inspected DMVs and Q&A docs (temporary/registration manuals) but did not find a clear statement about O vs 0 in general serials. (needs verification). DMV
 Vermont — No clear public rule found in quick search. (needs verification).
West Virginia — No clear public rule found in quick search. (needs verification).
Wisconsin — No clear public rule found quickly; appears ambiguous in examples. (needs verification).
Wyoming — Examples of current Wyoming serials show 0 in numeric positions; letter O not evidenced in sample serials I found (so likely they use 0 for digits and avoid O in many standard serials), but I could not find a short formal rule text. (needs verification).
