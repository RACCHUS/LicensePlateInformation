## Application Impact

### For Data Entry Personnel:
1. **O vs 0 rules** clearly defined per state
2. **Stacked character handling** standardized
3. **Special symbols** documented (especially NH)
4. **Prefix rules** for special cases (MS National Guard, NC Supreme Court)

### For Processing System:
1. Validation rules can reference `processing_metadata.global_rules.stacked_characters`
2. Character restrictions enforced via `uses_zero_for_o` and `allows_letter_o`
3. State-specific edge cases documented in notes

### For Quality Assurance:
1. Clear rules for what to include/omit
2. Visual identifiers help verify correct plate identification
3. Special cases and exceptions documented

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Update all state JSONs with character rules
2. **TODO:** Run dropdown update script
3. **TODO:** Test application with updated rules

### Run This Command:
```bash
python scripts/updating/auto_update_dropdown.py
```

Then restart the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add visual validation for stacked characters
2. Implement real-time character validation based on state rules
3. Create training materials showing examples of stacked characters
4. Add plate images to demonstrate include/omit rules
