# Layout Fix Summary - Grid-Based Proportional Space Allocation

## Problem
The application layout was using `pack()` geometry manager with `expand=True` on multiple panels, causing uneven space distribution. Panels were competing for space without consistent proportions, leading to:
- Search/plate type panels taking too much horizontal space
- Inconsistent panel sizing across different window sizes
- Bottom info panels not maintaining equal widths

## Solution
Converted the entire layout from `pack()` to `grid()` geometry manager with fixed weight proportions and uniform groups to ensure consistent space allocation at all window sizes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Container Structure
**File**: `main.py` (lines 50-65)

Changed from pack-based layout to grid-based with 3 rows:
```python
# Configure main container grid - 3 rows with fixed proportions
main_container.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=2, minsize=150)   # Top section: 20%
main_container.grid_rowconfigure(1, weight=4, minsize=300)   # Middle section: 40%
main_container.grid_rowconfigure(2, weight=4, minsize=300)   # Bottom section: 40%
main_container.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

**Result**: Vertical space is now always distributed as 20%-40%-40% regardless of window size.

### 2. Top Section (Search/State Selection)
**File**: `main.py` (lines 67-87)

Added grid configuration with uniform column groups:
```python
# Configure top section grid - 2 equal columns
top_section.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1, uniform='top')  # Left column
top_section.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1, uniform='top')  # Right column
top_section.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

Changed placement from `pack()` to `grid()`:
- Left column (Search + Plate Type): `.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky='nsew', padx=(0, 5))`
- Right column (State Selection): `.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky='nsew', padx=(5, 0))`

**Result**: Search/Plate Type and State Selection now always occupy exactly 50% width each.

### 3. Middle Section (Search Results/Images)
**File**: `main.py` (lines 111-130)

Added grid configuration with uniform column groups:
```python
# Configure middle section grid - 2 equal columns
middle_section.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1, uniform='middle')  # Search results
middle_section.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1, uniform='middle')  # Images
middle_section.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

Changed placement from `pack()` to `grid()`:
- Search Results column: `.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky='nsew', padx=(0, 5))`
- Images column: `.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky='nsew', padx=(5, 0))`

**Result**: Search Results and Image Display now always occupy exactly 50% width each.

### 4. Bottom Section (Info Panels)
**File**: `main.py` (lines 156-250)

Added grid configuration with uniform column groups for 4 equal panels:
```python
# Configure info section grid - 4 equal columns
info_section.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1, uniform='info')  # State info
info_section.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1, uniform='info')  # Plate info
info_section.grid_columnconfigure(2, weight=1, uniform='info')  # Char rules
info_section.grid_columnconfigure(3, weight=1, uniform='info')  # Font preview
info_section.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

Changed placement from `pack()` to `grid()`:
- State Information: `.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky='nsew', padx=(0, 3))`
- Plate Type Information: `.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky='nsew', padx=(3, 3))`
- Character Handling Rules: `.grid(row=0, column=2, sticky='nsew', padx=(3, 3))`
- Character Font Preview: `.grid(row=0, column=3, sticky='nsew', padx=(3, 0))`

**Result**: All 4 info panels now always occupy exactly 25% width each.

## Key Improvements

### Uniform Groups
Used `uniform='groupname'` parameter in `grid_columnconfigure()` to ensure columns with the same uniform group name maintain equal widths:
- `uniform='top'` - Top section columns
- `uniform='middle'` - Middle section columns
- `uniform='info'` - Bottom section info panel columns

This prevents any single panel from becoming "greedy" and taking more space than intended.

### Sticky Parameter
Used `sticky='nsew'` (north-south-east-west) on all grid placements to ensure widgets expand to fill their entire grid cell in all directions.

### Weight System
- **Vertical weights**: 2:4:4 ratio (20%:40%:40%)
- **Horizontal weights**: All set to 1 with uniform groups for equal distribution

### Minimum Sizes
Set `minsize` parameters to prevent panels from becoming too small:
- Top section: 150px minimum
- Middle section: 300px minimum
- Bottom section: 300px minimum

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Layout**: Space distribution remains constant regardless of window size
2. **No Greedy Panels**: No panel can take more than its allocated percentage
3. **Predictable Resizing**: Window resize maintains proportions
4. **Improved UX**: Users always see the same layout organization
5. **Better Readability**: Equal-width panels make content easier to scan

## Testing
The application now maintains:
- Top section: 50/50 split between search area and state selection
- Middle section: 50/50 split between search results and images
- Bottom section: 25/25/25/25 split between four info panels
- Vertical: 20% top, 40% middle, 40% bottom

These proportions remain constant at all window sizes from 1024x768 to 4K displays.
