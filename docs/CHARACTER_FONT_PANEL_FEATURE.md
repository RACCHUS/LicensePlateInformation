# Character Font Panel - Dynamic State-Based Font Display

## Overview
**Feature:** Dynamic character font panel that changes based on selected state  
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## What Was Implemented

### New Component Structure

Created a dedicated component for character font display:

```
src/gui/components/font_display/
├── __init__.py
└── character_font_panel.py
```

This keeps `main.py` clean and modular!

---

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ **State Font Detection**

The panel reads each state's `main_font` field from their JSON files and maps it to appropriate system fonts:

**Font Mappings:**
- **Narrow/Condensed** → Arial Narrow
- **Sans Serif** → Arial
- **Monospace** → Courier New
- **Highway Gothic** → Arial (approximate)
- **Proprietary/Custom** → Arial Black
- **Default** → Courier New

### 2️⃣ **Character Restriction Display**

The panel visually shows character usage rules:

| Color | Meaning | Example States |
|---|---|---|
| **🟢 Green** | Character is used | Most states |
| **🔴 Red** | Character NOT used | Florida (no 'O'), Maine (no 'O'/'I') |
| **🟠 Orange** | Used in special cases | Nevada ('0' on personalized only) |
| **Special** | Modified display | Ø for slashed zero |

### 3️⃣ **Special Handling**

**Florida:**
- Letter 'O' → Red (not used)
- Number '0' → Green (only this is used)
- Status: "✅ Only uses '0', not 'O'"

**Nevada (Unique Dual System):**
- Letter 'O' → Green (used on all plates)
- Number '0' → Orange (personalized plates only)
- Status: "⚠️ O/0 depends on plate type"

**Maine:**
- Letter 'O' → Red (not used - confused with 0)
- Letter 'I' → Red (not used - confused with 1)

## Component API

### CharacterFontPanel Class

```python
from gui.components.font_display.character_font_panel import CharacterFontPanel

# Initialize
panel = CharacterFontPanel(parent_widget, widget_factory)

# Update for a state
panel.update_state('FL', 'Florida')  # Changes font and shows restrictions

# Clear display
panel.clear()  # Reset to default

# Get the frame
frame = panel.get_frame()
```

---

## Features

### ✅ Dynamic Font Changes
When you select a state, the character display:
1. **Changes font** based on that state's license plate font
2. **Shows character restrictions** with color coding
3. **Displays special notes** about O/0/I usage

### ✅ Visual Character Grid
- **36 characters** displayed: A-Z, 0-9
- **6 columns** for optimal layout
- **Large, readable fonts** (14pt bold)
- **Color-coded restrictions**

### ✅ Intelligent Detection
- **Reads state JSON files** for font info
- **Detects character restrictions** automatically
- **Handles special cases** (Nevada dual system, slashed zero)
- **Falls back gracefully** if data is missing

### ✅ Status Information
Shows at bottom of panel:
- Current state name
- Active restrictions
- Special character rules

## Usage in Main Application

### In main.py:

```python
# Import the component
from gui.components.font_display.character_font_panel import CharacterFontPanel

# Create it
self.character_font_panel = CharacterFontPanel(font_column, self.widget_factory)

# Update when state selected
self.character_font_panel.update_state(state_code, state_name)

# Clear when filter cleared
self.character_font_panel.clear()
```

**Lines of code removed from main.py:** ~60 lines  
**Lines of code in new component:** ~340 lines (with proper structure)

---

## Font Mapping Examples

### States and Their Fonts:

| State | main_font Description | Mapped To | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **California** | "Highway Gothic" | Arial | 14pt bold |
| **Florida** | "Narrow sans serif" | Arial Narrow | 14pt bold |
| **Texas** | "Sans serif, proprietary" | Arial Black | 14pt bold |
| **Nevada** | "Custom sans serif" | Arial Black | 14pt bold |
| **New York** | "Helvetica variant" | Helvetica | 14pt bold |

---

## Character Restriction Detection

The component checks multiple sources:

```python
# Top-level fields
state_data.get('allows_letter_o')
state_data.get('uses_zero_for_o')
state_data.get('zero_is_slashed')

# Nevada's special dual system
state_data.get('letter_o_and_zero_usage')

# Processing metadata
state_data['processing_metadata']['global_rules']['character_restrictions']
```

## Visual Examples

### Default State (No Selection):
```
[A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F]
[G] [H] [I] [J] [K] [L]
[M] [N] [O] [P] [Q] [R]
[S] [T] [U] [V] [W] [X]
[Y] [Z] [0] [1] [2] [3]
[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

Status: "Select a state to see character font examples"
```

### Florida Selected:
```
[A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F]
[G] [H] [I] [J] [K] [L]
[M] [N] [Ø] [P] [Q] [R]  ← Red 'O' (not used)
[S] [T] [U] [V] [W] [X]
[Y] [Z] [0] [1] [2] [3]  ← Green '0' (used)
[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

Font: Arial Narrow 14pt bold
Status: "Font preview for Florida"
        "✅ Only uses '0', not 'O'"
```

### Nevada Selected:
```
[A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F]
[G] [H] [I] [J] [K] [L]
[M] [N] [O] [P] [Q] [R]  ← Green 'O' (all plates)
[S] [T] [U] [V] [W] [X]
[Y] [Z] [0] [1] [2] [3]  ← Orange '0' (personalized only)
[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

Font: Arial Black 14pt bold
Status: "Font preview for Nevada"
        "⚠️ O/0 depends on plate type"
```

## Technical Details

### Font Fallback System:
```python
1. Check state's main_font field
2. Match to FONT_MAPPINGS dictionary (keyword search)
3. Fall back to default if no match
4. Always use bold weight for visibility
```

### Character Rule Priority:
```python
1. Check uses_zero_for_o (Florida-style)
2. Check allows_letter_o (letter O restrictions)
3. Check letter_o_and_zero_usage (Nevada dual system)
4. Check zero_is_slashed (slashed zero)
5. Default to allowing all characters
```

### Color Coding Logic:
```python
- Red (#ff6666): Character NOT used
- Green (#66ff66): Character IS used (standard)
- Orange (#ffaa66): Character used in special cases
- White (#ffffff): Default/no restrictions
```

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/gui/components/font_display/__init__.py` - Package init
2. `src/gui/components/font_display/character_font_panel.py` - Main component (340 lines)

### Files Modified:
1. `main.py` - Added import, replaced inline code with component
   - Added 1 import line
   - Replaced ~60 lines with 1 line instantiation
   - Updated 2 method calls

## Testing

### To Test:

1. **Run Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select States:**
   - Florida → See Arial Narrow, red 'O', green '0'
   - Nevada → See Arial Black, green 'O', orange '0'
   - California → See Arial, default colors
   - Maine → See restrictions for 'O' and 'I'

3. **Clear Filter:**
   - Click "Clear Filter"
   - Panel resets to default Courier New
   - All characters white

4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Font changes per state
   - ✅ Colors match restrictions
   - ✅ Status text updates
   - ✅ Clear works correctly
