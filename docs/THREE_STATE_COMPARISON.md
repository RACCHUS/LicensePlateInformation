## Character Handling Comparison

### Illinois: Focus on Suffix/Prefix Modifications

**Key Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **ADD "ST" suffix** - Semi-Trailer plates
- ‚úÖ **ADD "B" suffix** - B Truck plates  
- ‚úÖ **ADD "AM" suffix** - Ambulance plates
- ‚úÖ **INCLUDE "HAM"** - Ham Radio plates
- ‚ùå **OMIT "RADIO"** - Ham Radio plates (omit this word)
- ‚ùå **OMIT small 'T'** - Commercial plates with small T character
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No alpha-numeric mixing** - Cannot mix letters and numbers

**Example:**
```
Plate shows: 12345 (Semi-Trailer)
Process as: 12345ST (ADD ST suffix)

Plate shows: HAM RADIO ABC123
Process as: HAM ABC123 (INCLUDE HAM, OMIT RADIO)
```

**Code Numbers:** 31, 35, 44, 46, 57, 77 (6 codes)

### Ohio: Focus on Vertical Text Omission

**Key Rules:**
- ‚ùå **OMIT vertical "VET"** - Veteran plates with stacked VET text
- ‚ùå **OMIT vertical "OHIO"** - Plates with vertical state name
- ‚ùå **OMIT small/stacked characters** - Tiny text on plate edges
- ‚ùå **OMIT company names** - Corporate logos and company text
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Zero cannot be alone** - Zero must appear with at least one 1-9 digit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No duplicate characters** - Except dealer plates

**Example:**
```
Plate shows: VET
             ABC123 (VET stacked vertically)
Process as: ABC123 (OMIT vertical VET)

Plate shows: 000 (all zeros)
Action: REJECT - Zero cannot be alone
```

**Code Numbers:** 31, 35, 45, 46, 47, 50, 68, 75, 77, 80 (10 codes)
