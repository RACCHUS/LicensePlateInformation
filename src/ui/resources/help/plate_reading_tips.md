# Plate Reading Tips

Guidance for reading difficult or partially obscured license plates.

## Obscured/Partial Plates

When parts of a plate are not visible:

### What to Look For

1. **Visible characters** - Enter what you can clearly see
2. **State identifiers** - Slogans, colors, and designs can help identify the state
3. **Plate format** - Use known patterns to infer missing characters

### Tips for Partial Plates

- **Front vs Rear** - Some states only require rear plates
- **Frame obstruction** - License plate frames may cover state names
- **Dirt/damage** - Look for character outlines even if faded

## Damaged Characters

When characters are damaged but the plate is otherwise visible:

### Reading Damaged Plates

1. **Context clues** - Use the known format to narrow possibilities
2. **Character shape** - Even partial shapes can identify letters/numbers
3. **O vs 0 rules** - Check if the state uses O or 0 (see Character Recognition)

### Common Damage Patterns

- **Faded paint** - Look at edges of characters
- **Bent plates** - Characters may be distorted but recognizable
- **Peeling** - Underlying character may be visible

## Stacked Characters

Some plates have stacked (small) characters, often for county or special designations.

### Reading Stacked Characters

Each state has specific rules about which characters can appear stacked:

- **Include list** - Characters that CAN be stacked
- **Omit list** - Characters to IGNORE when stacked

Check the **Character Rules** panel for the selected state to see:
- Whether stacked characters apply
- Which characters to include/omit

### Common Stacked Character Uses

1. **County codes** - Often 2-3 character county identifier
2. **Vehicle class** - Truck, trailer, motorcycle designation
3. **Year/registration** - Registration year or period
4. **Special status** - Veteran, disabled, etc.

## O vs 0 (Oh vs Zero)

This is one of the most common sources of error. Each state has specific rules:

### State Rules

- **Some states use only 0** - Never use letter O in plates
- **Some states allow both** - Context determines which
- **Some states use slashed 0** - Ø to differentiate from O

Check the **Character Rules** panel for:
- Whether the state uses O, 0, or both
- Whether zeros are slashed
- Position-based rules (some states have different rules for different positions)

### Visual Differences

| Character | Appearance |
|-----------|------------|
| O (letter) | Perfectly round, no slash |
| 0 (zero) | Often narrower, may have slash |
| Ø (slashed zero) | Zero with diagonal line |

## When All Else Fails

1. **Check state info** - Plate formats and rules provide clues
2. **Review images** - Sample images show typical plate appearance
3. **Use known formats** - Most plates follow predictable patterns
4. **Document uncertainty** - Note when characters are unclear
