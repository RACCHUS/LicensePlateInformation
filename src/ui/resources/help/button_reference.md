# Button Reference Guide

This guide explains when to use each button during plate entry.

---

## Accept Button {#accept}

**Use when:** The state, plate type, and plate characters are all correct and verified.

This is the standard submission when you have successfully read and entered the plate information. Only use Accept when you are confident the entry is accurate.

---

## P - Plate Unreadable {#p_unreadable}

**Use when:** The plate is bent, dirty, dented, faded, or otherwise unverifiable.

### Examples:
- Plate is physically bent or damaged
- Dirt, mud, or debris covering characters
- Severe fading making characters illegible
- Dents obscuring character shapes
- Paint peeling or flaking
- Rust damage

**Note:** If you can partially read the plate but not verify all characters, use P.

---

## O - Plate Obscured {#o_obscured}

**Use when:** An object is blocking the plate view.

### Common Obstructions:
- Plate covers (tinted or clear)
- Decorative plate frames blocking characters
- Stickers on or near the plate
- Trailer hitch blocking view
- Rope, straps, or tie-downs
- Bike racks or cargo carriers
- Spare tire mounts
- Bumper stickers overlapping plate

**Note:** The plate itself may be in good condition, but something is preventing you from seeing it clearly.

---

## N - No Plate Visible {#n_no_plate}

**Use when:** The back of the vehicle is shown but no plate is visible.

### Common Scenarios:
- Tailgate is down blocking plate location
- Plate mounting area is empty
- Temporary/paper plate that's blank or missing
- Vehicle has no rear plate (dealer transport, etc.)
- Camera angle doesn't capture plate area

**Note:** This is different from Obscured - with N, there's simply no plate to read in the expected location.

---

## T - Technical Issue {#t_technical}

**Use when:** Image quality issues prevent plate reading.

### Technical Problems Include:
- **Glare** - Bright reflection washing out the plate
- **Snow/Ice** - Weather covering the plate
- **Distortion** - Image warping or blur
- **Too Light** - Overexposed image
- **Too Dark** - Underexposed/nighttime with no lighting
- **Split Image** - Frame captured during camera transition
- **Motion Blur** - Vehicle moving too fast
- **Compression Artifacts** - Poor image quality

**Note:** The plate may be physically fine, but the image capture has a problem.

---

## E - Emergency Vehicle {#e_emergency}

**Use when:** The vehicle is a marked emergency response vehicle.

### Qualifies as Emergency:
- **Police** - Marked patrol cars with official insignia
- **Fire** - Fire trucks, fire department vehicles
- **Ambulance/EMT** - Marked emergency medical vehicles
- **City/County** - Official marked emergency response

### Does NOT Qualify:
- Unmarked police vehicles
- Personal vehicles with emergency lights
- Private ambulance services (unless marked)
- Tow trucks
- Utility vehicles

**See Also:** Help → Emergency Vehicle Guide for detailed identification tips.

---

## X - Other {#x_other}

**Use when:** Special situations not covered by other buttons.

### Common Uses:
- **Two motorcycles side by side** - Cannot determine which plate belongs to which vehicle
- **Miscellaneous government agencies** - Non-emergency government vehicles
- **Diplomatic plates** - Special diplomatic vehicle plates
- **Military vehicles** - DOD or military installation vehicles
- **Unusual plate formats** - Plates that don't fit standard categories

**Note:** Use sparingly - most situations should fit one of the other categories.

---

## R - Mark for Review {#r_review}

**Use when:** You need supervisor assistance or a second opinion.

### When to Use:
- Plate is partially readable but you're uncertain
- Unusual plate format you haven't seen before
- State identification is unclear
- Plate type is ambiguous
- You suspect the plate may be fraudulent
- Any situation requiring supervisor verification

**What Happens:** The image is sent to V4 for supervisor review. A supervisor will make the final determination.

**Note:** When in doubt, use R rather than guessing incorrectly.
