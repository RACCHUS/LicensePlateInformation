# Emergency Vehicle Guide

This guide helps identify **marked emergency vehicles** for toll processing purposes.

## What Counts as Emergency?

Only **marked** emergency vehicles are considered emergency in the system:

### ✅ Emergency Vehicles (Marked)

- **Police** - Clearly marked patrol cars with department name/badge visible
- **Fire** - Fire trucks, fire department vehicles with markings
- **Ambulance** - Marked ambulances with medical service identification
- **Emergency Responders** - Other marked first responder vehicles (EMT, rescue)

### ❌ NOT Emergency Vehicles

- **Unmarked police vehicles** - No visible department markings
- **Non-emergency medical transport** - Patient transport without emergency status
- **Personal vehicles of first responders** - Even with lights/sirens
- **Government vehicles** - Unless specifically marked as emergency response

## Identifying Emergency Plates

Most states use special plate formats for emergency vehicles:

### Common Emergency Plate Features

1. **"EXEMPT" marking** - Many emergency plates are marked exempt
2. **"E" prefix or suffix** - Emergency designation
3. **"GOV" or "GOVT"** - Government plates (may include emergency)
4. **Department-specific formats** - Fire, Police, EMS designations
5. **Municipal plates** - City/county government emergency vehicles

### State-Specific Notes

Emergency plate formats vary by state. Check the state info panel for details on:
- Exempt plate formats
- Government plate patterns
- Municipal emergency designations

## Processing Tips

1. **Look for markings first** - Vehicle markings are the primary indicator
2. **Check the plate type** - Emergency plates often have distinct formats
3. **Verify exempt status** - Many emergency vehicles have exempt plates
4. **When in doubt** - Check state-specific rules in the info panel

## Important Reminder

**Unmarked vehicles are NOT emergency vehicles** regardless of:
- Lights and sirens present
- Driver claiming emergency status
- Type of vehicle

The vehicle must have **visible department markings** to qualify as an emergency vehicle in the system.
